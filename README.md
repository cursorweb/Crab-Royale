# Crab Royale
This is a fun little game I am making with my friends! The goal is to have a game with crabs that fight each other!

## Arena
The arena is surrounded by a giant tsunami that will fling you into the center!! Super easy to get kills for crab coins, the premium currency to buy skins and other cosmetics.

## Controls
Designed for mobile only, (pc players will have a very bad time) left hand bar is for movement, and right side is for combat. WASD/Arrow Keys to move and click and hold to attack. Mouse to look around.

## Screenshots

## Firebase
Eventually, we will use firebase as the storage. Yay!

## Contributing
Bug reports and pull requests will be appreciated, but this is more of a personal project.
